## Add a Location
Before you can create an event, you need to add a location (venue). This is a simple, one-time process per venue.

### Steps to Add a Location
Ensure youâ€™re logged in and have already created an organisation. Navigate to the **Event Manager** from the main menu, and select **Locations** in the sidebar.

#### 1. Open the Popup
Click the purple **+** button in the top-right corner to open the location form popup.

#### 2. Fill Out the Form
Complete as much of the form as possible. The more details you provide, the better your events will appear and the easier they will be to find. You can leave the coordinates fields empty for now.

#### 3. Load the Coordinates
Click the **Load Coordinates** button to automatically fill in the coordinates based on your address details. If needed, you can adjust the coordinates manually. These are used to display a map on the event info page.
