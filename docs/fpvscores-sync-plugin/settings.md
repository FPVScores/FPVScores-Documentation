# Setup Plugin Settings
The FPVScores Sync plugin houses a few settings. These are located under the FPVScores Sync section on the Format page within your RotorHazard server.

![FPVScores Sync Settings Tab](/img/fpvscores_format_settings.png)


## FPV Scores Event UUID
The **Event UUID** is mandatory and can be found on the FPVScores.com platform after creating an event. This ID should be kept secret as it can be used to upload/change laps and results.



## Enable Automatic Sync
With the 'Enable Automatic Sync' checkbox you can enable the system to run automated uploads during the event.


## Full Manual Sync
The Full Manual Sync button let's you upload the whole event results to the FPVScores.com platform.


## Clear Event Data
This removes all results data that is imported to an event on FPVScores.com. This can be handy when there went something wrong with an upload and the data on the platform is incorrect.
