# OSD Lap Times
Set your ELRS Bindphrase and/or TBS Fusion MAC address in your account so it can be scanned into the Rotorhazard laptimer with your QR code. This allows the race director to send lap times to your goggles OSD.

## Saving your bindphrase or MAC address to your account
1. Login to your FPVScores Pilot Account
2. Open the Pilot Dropdown (upper-right) and navigate to [Account Settings](https://fpvscores.com/my-account/settings)
3. Navigate to the '[Change Avatar](https://fpvscores.com/my-account/change-avatar)' tab on the vertical menu on the left side.
4. Choose your avatar file and press the Upload Avatar button.

Now your credentials are visible on your [Pilot Card](/docs/pilots/pilot-card) and included in your Pilot's QR-code.
