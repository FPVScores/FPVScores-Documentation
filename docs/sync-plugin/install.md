# Install Plugin
To add and run a plugin, place the plugin's entire directory in `/src/server/plugins`, and (re)start the server.
Check if the directory contains the `__init__.py` to be sure you have uploaded the correct folder.

## Run Plugin
When the plugin is installed in the directory the server should be (re-)started to load the plugin.
